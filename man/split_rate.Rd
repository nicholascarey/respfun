\title{Divide a metabolic rate amongst a group}
\usage{
split_rate(x, tR = NULL, b = 0.75)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{numeric. A vector of body masses of all individuals in group}

\item{tR}{numeric. Total group metabolic rate}

\item{b}{numeric. Metabolic scaling exponent}
}
\value{
Output is a \code{list} object containing 5 numeric elements:

$a = \code{a} in the mass~rate power equation. Determined by the function.

$b = \code{b} in the mass~rate power equation. User entered.

$tR = total group rate. User entered.

$masses = specimen masses. User entered.

$indiv.rates = Primary output of interest. Group rate divided between
individuals. Sum should therefore equal tR. Determined by the function
}
\description{
Divide a metabolic rate amongst a group of individuals.

\details{
Divides a group metabolic rate amongst individuals, given body masses of
each and a scaling exponent.
