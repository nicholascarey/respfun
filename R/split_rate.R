#' @title Divide a metabolic rate amongst a group
#'
#' @description Divide a metabolic rate amongst a group of individuals.
#'
#' @details Divides a group metabolic rate amongst individuals, given body
#'   masses of each and a scaling exponent.
#'
#'   Take care to enter the correct scaling exponent (`b`). This is usually
#'   (with exceptions) a positive value between 0.66 and 1. If your `b` value is
#'   less than this, especially if it is less than 0.33, and ESPECIALLY if it is
#'   negative, then it is likely a MASS-SPECIFIC scaling exponent. The correct
#'   scaling exponent is the positive difference of this value from 1. For
#'   example, for a scaling exponent of 0.75, the mass-specific scaling exponent
#'   would be -0.25.
#'
#'   If, for whatever reason, you want to do a simple per-capita division of the
#'   rate regardless of the body masses, enter `b = 0`. Or just divide it by the
#'   number of individuals.
#'
#' @usage split_rate(masses, tR = NULL, b = 0.75)
#'
#' @param masses numeric. A vector of body masses of all individuals in group
#' @param tR numeric. Total group metabolic rate
#' @param b numeric. Metabolic scaling exponent
#'
#' @return Output is a \code{list} object containing 5 numeric elements:
#'
#'   $a = \code{a} in the mass~rate power equation. Determined by the function.
#'
#'   $b = \code{b} in the mass~rate power equation. User entered.
#'
#'   $tR = total group rate. User entered.
#'
#'   $masses = specimen masses. User entered.
#'
#'   $indiv.rates = Primary output of interest. Group rate divided between
#'   individuals. Sum should therefore equal tR. Determined by the function

## R = a*(M^b)
## R = NON-mass specific Oâ‚‚ uptake rate
## a = intercept
## M = mass
## b = scaling exponent (typically 0.66/0.75/1)
## NOT the mass-specific one - should be the positive difference from 1
## i.e. MASS-SPECIFIC scaling expoenent of -0.25 means an actual scaling exponent of 0.75

## therefore, Total Group Rate (tR):
## tR = a*(M1^b) + a*(M2^b) + a*(M3^b) .....
## M1,M2 = masses of specimens 1, 2...
## a and b are the same for every specimen

## rearrange
## a = tR/(sum(M1^b + M2^b + M3^b.....))

## pick an appropriate b value

## then to get the scaled rate of each specimen put its mass into the equation
## R = a*(M^b)

## sum of scaled rates should equal tR

## x should be a vector of masses, tR is total group rate

  ## check b is within fairly normal range - but don't stop function
  ## just a warning in case user enters MASS SPECIFIC scaling exponent
